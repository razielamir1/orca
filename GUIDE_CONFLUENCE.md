## 1. What Is This?

A system of **15 specialized AI agents** that work together as a complete development team inside Claude Code. Instead of one AI doing everything, tasks are routed to the right specialist — just like a real team.

**Key benefits:**
- Each agent has deep expertise in its domain
- Read-only agents (QA, security, code review, architect) can never accidentally break your code
- Agents maintain persistent memory — they learn your project over time
- Heavy analysis happens in isolated agent contexts, keeping your main conversation clean
- Safety hooks block destructive operations at the system level
- Slash commands automate common workflows with a single command

---

## 2. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Installed and authenticated |
| VSCode | With Claude Code extension |
| Git | For version control and subtree sync |

---

## 3. Installation

### Step 3.1 — New Project

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
3. Clone your new repository locally
4. Open it in VSCode
5. Type `/init-project` in the Claude chat — it auto-detects your tech stack and generates `CLAUDE.md`
6. Done! Start working with the agents

### Step 3.2 — Existing Project (Recommended)

This method supports pulling future agent updates.

**Step 3.2.1** — Open a terminal in your project directory

**Step 3.2.2** — Add the agents repository as a remote:
```bash
git remote add agents https://github.com/razielamir1/LeadOrchestratorAgent.git
git fetch agents
```

**Step 3.2.3** — Pull the `.claude` directory into your project:
```bash
git subtree add --prefix=.claude agents main --squash
```

**Step 3.2.4** — Open the project in VSCode and type `/init-project` in the Claude chat. The command will:
- Scan your project for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.
- Detect your frontend framework, backend framework, database, testing tools, and infrastructure
- Generate a customized `CLAUDE.md` with the correct tech stack

**Step 3.2.5** — Commit the changes:
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Add Lead Orchestrator Agent system"
```

### Step 3.3 — Updating Agents Later

When new agents are added or existing ones are improved:
```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=.claude agents main --squash
```

---

## 4. Your First Task

Let's walk through a real example to see the system in action.

### Step 4.1 — Open the project in VSCode

Open your project folder. Claude will automatically read `CLAUDE.md` and know about all 11 agents.

### Step 4.2 — Give a simple task

Type in the Claude chat:

```
Build me a health check endpoint that returns the server status and database connection status.
```

### Step 4.3 — Watch the delegation

The Lead Orchestrator will:
1. Recognize this is a backend task
2. Delegate to `backend-developer`
3. The backend-developer will present its plan and wait for you to type **PROCEED**
4. After implementation, optionally route to `qa-expert` to verify

### Step 4.4 — Review the output

Each agent returns a summary of what it did. Review the changes, and if you're happy, commit them.

---

## 5. Slash Commands

Slash commands are pre-built workflows that automate common multi-agent tasks.

| Command | What It Does | Agents Involved |
|---|---|---|
| `/init-project` | Auto-detects tech stack and generates `CLAUDE.md` | Lead Orchestrator |
| `/full-audit` | Runs full codebase audit, produces `FIXES.md` | qa + security + reviewer + perf → architect |
| `/new-feature <desc>` | Builds a feature end-to-end | architect → db → backend → frontend → ui → qa |
| `/fix-bug <desc>` | Diagnoses and fixes a bug | qa → dev agent → qa |
| `/security-check` | Focused security vulnerability scan | security-analyst |
| `/document <type>` | Generates documentation (api/readme/onboarding/jsdoc) | tech-writer |
| `/check-updates` | Checks for agent system updates and offers to install | Lead Orchestrator |

### How to use them

Type the command directly in the Claude chat:

```
/new-feature User authentication with JWT tokens and password reset
```

```
/fix-bug The checkout button is not responding on mobile devices
```

```
/document api
```

---

## 6. Working With Agents — Step by Step

### 6.1 — Automatic Delegation (Easiest)

**What:** Describe your task in natural language. The orchestrator picks the right agent(s).

**How:**
```
I need a user registration page with email validation and a database table to store users.
```

**What happens:**
1. `database-expert` creates the users table and migration
2. `backend-developer` creates the registration endpoint
3. `frontend-developer` builds the registration form logic
4. `ui-designer` styles the form

**When to use:** Most of the time. This is the default way to work.

---

### 6.2 — Direct Agent Invocation (@-mention)

**What:** Target a specific agent when you know exactly who should handle the task.

**How:**
```
@security-analyst scan all files in src/api/ for SQL injection vulnerabilities
```

**More examples:**
```
@architect design the data flow for a real-time chat feature
@tech-writer write JSDoc comments for all exported functions in src/utils/
@performance-optimizer analyze why the /api/products endpoint is slow
@devops-engineer create a Dockerfile for this project
```

**When to use:** When you want a specific expert's opinion, or when the orchestrator delegates to the wrong agent.

---

### 6.3 — Parallel Execution

**What:** Run multiple independent agents at the same time.

**How:**
```
Run these in parallel:
- @code-reviewer review src/api/
- @security-analyst audit src/api/
- @qa-expert check test coverage for src/api/
```

Or simply use `/full-audit` to run all 4 audit agents in parallel automatically.

**What happens:** All agents run simultaneously. Each writes its report to `.claude/audits/`. No agent blocks another.

**When to use:** For audits, reviews, and any tasks that don't depend on each other.

---

### 6.4 — Sequential Chaining

**What:** Run agents one after another, where each builds on the previous agent's work.

**How:**
```
Build a complete user profile feature:
1. @architect — design the architecture
2. @database-expert — create the schema
3. @backend-developer — build the API
4. @frontend-developer — build the page logic
5. @ui-designer — style the page
6. @qa-expert — test everything
```

Or use `/new-feature user profile page with avatar upload` to run the full pipeline automatically.

**When to use:** For full-stack features where order matters.

---

### 6.5 — Background Execution

**What:** Run an agent in the background while you continue working.

**How:**
```
Run @qa-expert in the background to scan the entire project for bugs
```

**Alternative:** Press **Ctrl+B** to move a currently running task to the background.

**What happens:** The agent works silently. When it finishes, you get a notification with the results.

**When to use:** For long-running tasks like full project scans, security audits, or test suites.

---

### 6.6 — Viewing Available Agents

**What:** See all agents and their descriptions.

**How:** Type `/agents` in the chat.

**What you see:** An interactive menu listing all 15 agents with their descriptions. You can select one to invoke it.

---

## 7. Advanced Workflows

### 7.1 — Full Feature Development

**Scenario:** You need to build a complete "Shopping Cart" feature.

```
/new-feature Shopping cart - users can add/remove products, cart persists across sessions, checkout calculates total with tax, responsive sidebar UI
```

**Agent flow:**
```
architect          → Designs the overall approach (waits for PROCEED)
  ↓
database-expert    → Creates cart_items table, indexes
  ↓
backend-developer  → Builds CRUD endpoints for cart
  ↓
frontend-developer → Builds cart state management, API hooks
  ↓
ui-designer        → Creates cart sidebar, animations
  ↓
qa-expert          → Tests all flows, edge cases
```

---

### 7.2 — Bug Investigation & Fix

**Scenario:** Users report that checkout sometimes fails.

```
/fix-bug Users are reporting intermittent checkout failures
```

**Agent flow:**
```
qa-expert              → Diagnoses the bug, identifies root cause
  ↓
backend-developer      → Fixes the root cause
  ↓
qa-expert              → Verifies the fix
```

---

### 7.3 — Pre-Release Audit

**Scenario:** You're about to release v2.0 and want a full quality check.

```
/full-audit
```

**Agent flow (all in parallel):**
```
code-reviewer          → AUDIT_CODE_REVIEW.md
security-analyst       → AUDIT_SECURITY.md
qa-expert              → AUDIT_QA.md
performance-optimizer  → AUDIT_PERFORMANCE.md
         ↓ (all complete)
architect              → Reads all reports → FIXES.md
```

Review `FIXES.md` and address findings before release.

---

### 7.4 — Onboarding Documentation

**Scenario:** A new developer is joining the team and needs documentation.

```
/document onboarding
```

---

## 8. Safety System

### 8.1 — Micro-Checkpoint Protocol (Prompt-Level)

Agents with Write permissions must **PAUSE and present their action plan** before executing changes that involve:

| Trigger | Example |
|---|---|
| 3+ file changes | Creating a new feature across multiple files |
| Database migrations | Adding a new table or modifying a schema |
| Configuration files | package.json, tsconfig, Dockerfile, CI/CD pipelines |
| Auth logic | Login, JWT, session management, permissions |
| Deletions | Removing files, endpoints, or functionality |

The agent presents its plan and waits for the user to type **PROCEED** before executing.

### 8.2 — Safety Hooks (System-Level)

A `PreToolUse` hook in `.claude/settings.json` blocks dangerous operations at the technical level — not a prompt instruction, but actual enforcement:

| Blocked Operation | What Gets Blocked |
|---|---|
| Destructive SQL | `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE FROM` |
| Recursive deletes | `rm -rf`, `rm -r /` |
| Force operations | `--force`, `--hard` |

When an agent tries a blocked operation, it receives an error message and cannot proceed. This provides a safety net beyond the prompt-level checkpoints.

---

## 9. Audit Report System

### How It Works

Audit agents write their findings to files in `.claude/audits/` instead of returning them in the conversation. This prevents "context rot" — where hundreds of lines of logs flood the main chat and degrade AI performance.

| Agent | Writes To |
|---|---|
| `qa-expert` | `.claude/audits/AUDIT_QA.md` |
| `security-analyst` | `.claude/audits/AUDIT_SECURITY.md` |
| `code-reviewer` | `.claude/audits/AUDIT_CODE_REVIEW.md` |
| `performance-optimizer` | `.claude/audits/AUDIT_PERFORMANCE.md` |

### Summarization

After all audit agents complete, the `architect` agent reads all 4 reports and produces a unified `FIXES.md` at the project root:
- Grouped by priority (critical → high → medium → low)
- Deduplicated (overlapping findings merged)
- Each fix assigned to the appropriate agent

### Git Exclusion

Audit reports are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. They are temporary working documents, not permanent artifacts.

---

## 10. Agent Reference Card

### Agents That WRITE Code

| Agent | Specialization | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt-architect` | Prompt engineering, requirements refinement | Transforming raw requests into precise specs |
| `business-analyst` | Market research, competitive analysis | Discovery, feasibility, benchmarking |
| `product-manager` | PRDs, user stories, feature specs | Product strategy, requirements, prioritization |
| `frontend-developer` | React, TypeScript, hooks, state | Page logic, data fetching, forms |
| `ui-designer` | TailwindCSS, components, layouts | Visual design, styling, responsiveness |
| `backend-developer` | Express, middleware, APIs | Endpoints, auth, server logic |
| `database-expert` | PostgreSQL, SQL, migrations | Schema design, queries, indexes |
| `devops-engineer` | Docker, CI/CD, deployment | Infrastructure, pipelines, configs |
| `performance-optimizer` | Profiling, caching, optimization | Speed improvements, bundle size |
| `tech-writer` | Documentation, JSDoc | API docs, README, guides |
| `git-manager` | Git workflow, branching, releases | PRs, tags, merge conflicts, repo hygiene |

### Agents That ADVISE Only

| Agent | Specialization | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `architect` | System design, scalability | Design documents, recommendations, FIXES.md |
| `code-reviewer` | Best practices, code quality | Review reports with severity levels |
| `security-analyst` | OWASP, vulnerability scanning | Security audit reports |
| `qa-expert` | Testing, bug hunting | Bug reports, coverage analysis |

---

## 11. Memory System

### How It Works

Each agent has a memory file at `.claude/agent-memory/<agent-name>/MEMORY.md`.

| Event | What Happens |
|---|---|
| Agent starts a task | Reads its memory file for past context |
| Agent finishes a task | Updates memory with new insights |
| New project | Memory starts empty, builds over time |

### What Gets Remembered

| Agent | Remembers |
|---|---|
| `prompt-architect` | Effective prompt patterns, common user gaps, project conventions |
| `business-analyst` | Market data, competitor intel, user personas |
| `product-manager` | Product decisions, feature history, stakeholder preferences |
| `architect` | Architecture decisions, trade-offs, patterns |
| `frontend-developer` | State patterns, API conventions, component structure |
| `ui-designer` | Design decisions, color schemes, component library |
| `backend-developer` | API patterns, middleware conventions, auth flows |
| `database-expert` | Schema history, index strategies, migration decisions |
| `devops-engineer` | Infrastructure configs, deployment steps, env vars |
| `code-reviewer` | Coding standards, recurring issues |
| `security-analyst` | Known vulnerabilities, security patterns |
| `performance-optimizer` | Benchmarks, optimization history, bottlenecks |
| `qa-expert` | Bug patterns, fragile areas, test strategies |
| `tech-writer` | Documentation style, terminology, gaps |
| `git-manager` | Branching conventions, release history, commit style |

### Manually Triggering Memory Save

If an agent didn't automatically save its findings:
```
@qa-expert save what you learned from this session to your memory
```

---

## 12. MCP — External Tool Integration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets your agents access external systems. All MCP servers are configured in `.claude/settings.json`.

### Available Integrations

| MCP Server | What It Provides | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | Direct database access | `@database-expert` reading schemas |
| GitHub | PR, issue, and repo access | `@code-reviewer` reading PRs |
| Slack | Channel messaging | Status updates and notifications |
| Filesystem | Access to external directories | Reading shared docs or design assets |

See [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md) for step-by-step setup instructions with configuration examples.

---

## 13. Context Efficiency

Subagents run in isolated contexts — their heavy processing stays in their own session and only a clean summary returns to the main conversation. This prevents context bloat and keeps costs down.

**Best practices:**
- Prefer delegating to agents over doing work inline
- Use `/full-audit` instead of asking each audit agent individually — it routes reports to files, not the chat
- For large codebases, target specific directories (e.g., "audit src/api/") rather than scanning everything

---

## 14. Customizing for Your Project

### Step 14.1 — Auto-Detect Tech Stack

Type `/init-project` in the Claude chat. It scans for:
- `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`
- `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/`
- `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.*`, `vite.config.*`
- `prisma/schema.prisma`, `knexfile.*`, `.env`
- `jest.config.*`, `vitest`, `cypress/`, `playwright/`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `nx.json`, `turbo.json`

### Step 14.2 — Add a New Agent

Create a file in `.claude/agents/` with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: my-new-agent
description: When to use this agent (the orchestrator reads this to decide delegation).
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
---
You are a senior [role]. Your expertise is [domain].

# Persistent Memory
Before starting any task, read `.claude/agent-memory/my-new-agent/MEMORY.md`.
When done, update it with new insights.

# Execution Flow
1. **Load Memory**
2. **Explore existing code**
3. **Execute task**
4. **Save Memory**

# Guidelines
- Specific rules for this agent
```

Then create the memory directory and file:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agent-memory/my-new-agent
echo "# My New Agent Memory" > .claude/agent-memory/my-new-agent/MEMORY.md
```

### Step 14.3 — Add a New Slash Command

Create a file in `.claude/commands/` (e.g., `.claude/commands/my-command.md`). The file content is the prompt that runs when a user types `/my-command`. Use `$ARGUMENTS` to capture user input.

### Step 14.4 — Remove an Agent

Delete its file from `.claude/agents/` and optionally remove its memory directory.

---

## 15. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Agent not found | Check that the `.md` file exists in `.claude/agents/` and has correct YAML frontmatter |
| Wrong agent picks up the task | Use `@agent-name` to explicitly target the right agent |
| Agent modifies code it shouldn't | Verify the agent's `tools` field doesn't include `Write` or `Edit` |
| Agent doesn't remember past context | Ask the agent to "read your memory file first", or check that the memory file path is correct in the agent prompt |
| Agent response is too slow | Change `model: opus` to `model: sonnet` for faster responses (at the cost of depth) |
| Subtree pull conflicts | Resolve merge conflicts in `.claude/` directory, keep your memory files |
| Agent generates wrong tech stack code | Run `/init-project` to re-detect your stack, or update agent prompts manually |
| Slash command not found | Check that the `.md` file exists in `.claude/commands/` |
| Safety hook blocks a valid operation | Edit `.claude/settings.json` to adjust the hook rules |
| Audit reports not generated | Verify audit agents have `Write` in their `tools` field |
| CLAUDE.md shows "(not detected)" | Run `/init-project` to auto-detect your tech stack |

### Git Subtree Installation Errors

**`fatal: not a git repository`**

The project is not initialized as a Git repo. Run first:
```bash
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

**`fatal: prefix '.claude' already exists`**

The project already has a `.claude` directory (from Claude Code or a previous install). Remove it first:
```bash
rm -rf .claude
git add -A && git commit -m "Remove old .claude directory"
git subtree add --prefix=.claude agents main --squash
```

**`fatal: working tree has modifications. Cannot add.`**

You have uncommitted changes. Commit them first:
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Save current state"
```
Then retry the subtree command.

**Full recovery sequence (run all in order):**
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Save current state"
rm -rf .claude
git add -A && git commit -m "Remove old .claude directory"
git remote add agents https://github.com/razielamir1/LeadOrchestratorAgent.git
git fetch agents
git subtree add --prefix=.claude agents main --squash
# Then type /init-project in Claude chat
```
